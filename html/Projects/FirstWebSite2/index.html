        Apple sauce is a purée(not necessarily served as a true sauce) made of apples.
        It can be made with peeled or unpeeled apples and can be spiced or sweetened.
        Apple sauce is inexpensive and is widely consumed in North America and some parts of Europe.
    </p>  
    <p>  
        A wide range of apple varieties are used to make apple sauce,
        depending on the preference for sweetness or tartness.
        Formerly, sour apples were usually used to make savory apple sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
        Commercial versions of apple sauce are readily available at supermarkets and other retail outlets.
