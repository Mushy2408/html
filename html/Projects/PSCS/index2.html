             More about Us
        </h2>
        <p>
            At Custom Scent Creations, we specialize in crafting personalized fragrances that reflect your unique personality and style. 
            Our scents are designed with the utmost care, blending premium ingredients to create a scent that enhances your 
            presence and expresses who you truly are.
        </p>
        <p>
            With our custom approach, you’re not just buying a fragrance — you’re creating

        <h2>
            Why We Chose to Create This
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our journey began with a simple idea: to help people create a fragrance that truly represents them. 
            We realized that a signature scent is a powerful form of self-expression, 
            and we wanted to offer a service that allows individuals to curate their own fragrances. 
            After months of research and development, we crafted a process that is both fun 
            and personal for our clients.

            Market Considerations
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Supply
        </h3>
        <p>
            Our scents will initially be sold locally in Ohio, but we plan to expand to a national market within the next year. 
            The product will be available both online and in select retail locations.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Target Consumer
        </h3>
        <p>
            Our target market is individuals aged 18-45 who are looking for a personalized, 
            unique scent. This includes perfume enthusiasts, those seeking a signature fragrance, 
            and individuals looking for memorable gifts.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Demand & Competition
        </h3>
        <p>
            While there is a demand for personalized fragrances, the market is competitive, 
            with many big brands offering limited options for customization. 
            We aim to stand out by offering a fully bespoke service with a focus on high-quality ingredients and customer experience.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Advertising Plan
        </h3>
        <p>
            We plan to advertise our product through social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest. 
            Influencer partnerships and targeted online ads will help us reach our audience. 
            We will also consider collaborating with lifestyle bloggers to review and promote our products.
